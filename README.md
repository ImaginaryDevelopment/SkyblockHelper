## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you can also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.

## Work with the application

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you should install its local tools with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```


To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
.\build.cmd
```

To update the bundle for github pages
```base
.\bundle.cmd
```
